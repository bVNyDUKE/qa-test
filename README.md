## QAgency test by DK

- I opted to pull all the API data on first load and save it in a store
- Alternatively, tanstack-query could be used for API management, caching, revaldation
- Used React Context combined with useReducer for state management, a better external tool would include selectors to minimize rerenders

## Technologies used

- Tailwind
- Vite
- React Router
