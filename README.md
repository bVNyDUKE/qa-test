## QAgency test by DK

- I opted to pull all the API data on first load and save it in a store
- Alternatively, tanstack-query could be used for API management, caching, revaldation
- Using react-router loaders is also an option, but the task specified no external state solutions
- Used React Context combined with useReducer for state management, a better external tool would include selectors to minimize rerenders
- Time to completion: 6 hours

## Technologies used

- Tailwind
- Vite
- React Router
